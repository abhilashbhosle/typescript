TYPESCRIPT:
==========
=>Typescript is considered as superset of javascript.
=>Typescript is just a development tool, but execution and all happens in javascript only.
=>Typescript does the static check, it make the developers aware of errors while writing the code.
=>* To transpile/convert ts to js we use syntax=> tsc filename

DATA TYPES IN TYPESCRIPT:
=========================
Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Void, Object, Array, Tupples, ...etc

SYNTAX:
======
let variableName:type=value
note: All the types in typescript are lowercase.

TYPE INFERENCE:
==============
=>In order to make the variable strictly to the type there is no need of mentioning type in the syntax.
=>As your file is .ts it automatically considers the type for which it's declared initially
eg : let variableName=value (THIS IS ALSO THE CORRECT FORMAT)
